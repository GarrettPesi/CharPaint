# CharPaint
CharPaint is a Java program that allows a user to draw pictures using ASCII characters.
Additional functionality includes being able to save and load created pictures, the ability to start over with a blank canvas, and undo/redo buttons.
Different ASCII characters can be selected by simply pressing them on the keyboard.

The CharPaintDriver.java file is just used to start the program.  The actual program is written in the CharPaint.java file.
